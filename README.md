# Project Title: "Simple To-Do List"
Purpose: A basic to-do list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Technologies:
Language: Java
Framework: Spring Boot
Database: H2 or MySQL

# Endpoints:
* POST /tasks: Create a new task. Input: { "task": "string" }
* GET /tasks: Retrieve a list of all tasks. Output: [ { "id": int, "task": "string" }, ... ]
* GET /tasks/{id}: Retrieve a single task by ID. Output: { "id": int, "task": "string" }
* PUT /tasks/{id}: Update a task by ID. Input: { "task": "string" }
* DELETE /tasks/{id}: Delete a task by ID.

# Other considerations:
* Use proper HTTP status codes for success and error responses
* Use a library like Bean Validation for input validation
* Use a library like Jackson for serialization and deserialization
* Follow the Java Code Convention for your code
* Use Git for version control
* You can use Spring Initializer to bootstrap your project and you can use Spring Data JPA for database related operation. This is a simple example, you can expand and customize as per your requirement.
